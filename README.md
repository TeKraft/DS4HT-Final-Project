# DS4HT-Final-Project

This repository contains a dataset from an existing hotel and an analysis on some aspects of the dataset made with jupyter notebook. The project is the final submission of the course Data Science for Hospitality and Tourism at Nova Information Management School in Lisbon, Portugal. Intention of the course was to learn and improve skills in the programming language python and, further, learn how to use this programming language for descriptive statistics in data science by analysing a dataset in the field of Hospitality and Tourism.

### Project Description

This project intends to analyse data from an existing hotel using techniques from data science to get deeper insight of a hotel's business performance during the last six years and understand how this analysis can help the management decision process of the hotel. Located in the western part of Germany, the hotel attracts both business and leisure tourism. The dataset comprises information about the guests, local and foreign, occupied rooms and revenue from 01-2013 to 12-2018. The analysis stated in this report compares the number of local and foreign rooms, finds correlations and compares monthly variance (and periodicity), and does a time series analysis of occupied rooms and revenue.

The complete report on the analysis, limited to a specified number of pages, can be found in the folder called "FinalProject_DS4HT_AnaPeralta_TorbenKraft.pdf".
